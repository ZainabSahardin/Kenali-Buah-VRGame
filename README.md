# Kenali-Buah-VRGame
Tak kenal maka tak cinta =)

This project focuses on low-polygon virtual reality (VR) games with a kid-friendly interface and language-learning benefits. The game's virtual classroom setting fosters an environment that is dynamic and adventurous, which makes learning fun. The game's cute aesthetics and vibrant colors seek to improve language acquisition, particularly for young learners. The objective of the game is to introduce the fruit's name in Bahasa Melayu and the user will be tested in PLAY mode where they can virtually grab the fruits on a table and match them with the correct name.

This system is deployed to Meta Quest 2 which comes with various input devices to capture the player's movements and actions. Handheld controllers and hand-tracking sensors are optimized for this project.
